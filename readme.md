# Music Genre Identification using Machine Learning
Here, an analysis has been performed to identify music genre using 5 second audio clips using various machine learning algorithms on Python 3.6

## Questions:
We are attempting to answer the following questions:
* Can the developed algorithm classify audio clips of bands belonging to different genres?
* How accurately does the algorithm work when the same task has to be performed for bands within the same genre?
* How well does the algorithm perform when we just want to predict the genre given a 5 second audio clip?

## Files:
* Github_report.pdf - Contains the documentation and explaination for the development of the algorithm.
* Part1.py - Contains code for answering the 1st question.
* Part2.py - Contains code for answering the 2nd question.
* Part3.py - Contains code for answering the 3rd question.
